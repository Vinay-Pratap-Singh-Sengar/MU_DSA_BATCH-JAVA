SP == CP → No Profit No Loss
```

### Formula

```text
Profit = SP - CP

Loss = CP - SP
```

# Part H – Employee Salary

## 24. Calculate Gross Salary

Write a program to input the basic salary of an employee and calculate the gross salary according to the following conditions.

### Salary Structure

#### Basic Salary ≤ ₹10,000

```text
HRA = 20%
DA  = 80%
```

#### Basic Salary ≤ ₹20,000

```text
HRA = 25%
DA  = 90%
```

#### Basic Salary > ₹20,000

```text
HRA = 30%
DA  = 95%
```

### Formula

```text
HRA Amount = Basic Salary × HRA / 100

DA Amount = Basic Salary × DA / 100

Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA Amount + DA Amount
```

Use `float` or `double` for salary calculations because percentages can produce decimal values.

# Part I – Electricity Bill

## 25. Calculate Electricity Bill

Write a program to input electricity units and calculate the total electricity bill according to the following conditions.

### Electricity Charges

| Units           | Rate       |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| First 50 units  | ₹0.50/unit |
| Next 100 units  | ₹0.75/unit |
| Next 100 units  | ₹1.20/unit |
| Above 250 units | ₹1.50/unit |

An additional **20% surcharge** is added to the bill.

### Slab Calculation

#### If units ≤ 50

```text
Bill = units × 0.50
```

#### If units are between 51 and 150

```text
First 50 units → 50 × 0.50
Remaining units → (units - 50) × 0.75
```

#### If units are between 151 and 250

```text
First 50 units  → 50 × 0.50
Next 100 units  → 100 × 0.75
Remaining units → (units - 150) × 1.20
```

#### If units are above 250

```text
First 50 units   → 50 × 0.50
Next 100 units   → 100 × 0.75
Next 100 units   → 100 × 1.20
Remaining units  → (units - 250) × 1.50
```

### Surcharge

After calculating the bill:

```text
Surcharge = Bill × 20 / 100

Final Bill = Bill + Surcharge
```

# 📌 Homework Rules

For every program:

## 1. Take Input

Do not hard-code the values.

❌ Avoid:

```java
int number = 25;
```

Prefer:

```java
int number;

System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
number = scanner.nextInt();
```

---

## 2. Display Meaningful Output

❌ Avoid:

```text
25
```

Prefer:

```text
25 is divisible by 5
```

---

## 3. Use Proper Variable Names

Prefer:

```java
int number;
int marks;
double salary;
int month;
```

Avoid unnecessary names such as:

```java
int x;
int a;
int z;
```

---

## 4. Follow Proper Formatting

Example:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EvenOdd {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int number;

        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        number = scanner.nextInt();

        if (number % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Number is even");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Number is odd");
        }

    }
}
```
